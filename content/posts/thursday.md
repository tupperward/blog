This post will be periodically updated as we travel throughout the day. I've set it as a draft for now (so this should be erased), but we'll see how that goes.

I hate traveling, particularly flying. I'm over 6 foot tall, so there's no comfortable way to sit in an airline seat for me. On top of that, I'm a Big Dude[^1] so it's even harder to just sit comfortably than you'd imagine. Last year we took the train west to Oregon and that was truly a delight. I'm less than thrilled about going through TSA again and I'm certainly less than thrilled about being in an absolute hellscape of suburban north-central Texas

I think we're pretty well prepared, but I just don't know how to handle a baby in a plane. We'll see, I guess.
