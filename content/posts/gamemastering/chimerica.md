## A Title

I'd like to introduce you to a project I've been tumbling around in my head for about a decade now when I started doodling a new campaign setting I could use to get my friends into playing the brand new and shiny 5th Edition of the vaunted Dungeons and Dragons. The first idea I had was for a region enclosed by mountains and a coast to the east that was a colonized territory to another state far across the ocean, subconciously recreating the "areas surrounded by cliffs" kind of design that hit its peak in the heyday of the N64. It was in about 2017 that I stared working on a 1-to-1 mapping of a fantasy setting over a map of a fantasy setting and a map of North America. This was a fun thing to play with during slow work days but it often resorted to some pretty hack stereotypes and ripping off Keith Baker wholecloth (whole hat notwithstanding). It wasn't until 2020 I discovered Kcymaerxthere, a cool art project by a rich guy who took one too many candle sticks to the dome from ol' Col. Mustard. This project gave me the inspiration to break away from hollow puns and focus more on a localized story thanvestigatet the players could be more invested in.

Which is to say, I took the most basic GM advice possible: don't be so ambitious. 

So I narrowed the scope of the project to very specific regions of the map I could dig into. The first of these was a campaign roughly based in southern Ohio just shy of the Appalachian foothills to the east of where we happen to live. There was a nice little town on the map called Oak Hill that I decided to work from and then build a hexcrawl out of the area around it. This went...ok.
