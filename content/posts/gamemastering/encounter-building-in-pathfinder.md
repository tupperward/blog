# I've Been Procrastinating

I have a whole Pathfinder 2E Campaign that I'm working on that I really need to be working on and, unfortunately for the group and for me, Baldur's Gate 3 finally came out after I started playing it 5 years ago. It's a game strong enough to pull my wife away from the Sims for whole days at a time. Do you know how many hours of [lilsmise](https://www.youtube.com/lilsimsie) she watches every week? It's gotta enough to make [Ms Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/@msrachel) blush.[^1] I've been playing even more than she has been, and I'm only level 7 on my main character! All the momentum I had built up writing for Chimerica[^2] was just absolutely decimated, and I promised that I would get at least 3 whole sessions written before we started so I can feel comfortable that we have enough padding to build meet regularly and have it not be my fault. 

So what do I need to do about it? Well, I what I figured is I can force myself to make a few encounters by making them examples for "my" brand new session prep system. That's right, you get to be the very rubber duck I needed to get over the hump here. Well, that and I guess a folk punk playlist? I dunno, we'll probably address what Spotify is doing as we work through this. Well, I've been stalling long enough, let's get to it!

# Let's Get To It

So what's the process? Well I really am a huge fan of the Lazy Dungeonmaster's Way method of prepping a session, because if you have enough bullshit on hand you should be able to come up with something pretty quickly and do so in a way that builds on what the characters have been doing. Everything I like to do works best either with stacks and stacks of well organized index cards or, and this is a fun little secret between you and me, [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).[^3] In the very small amount of prep I've done so far, I feel like Pathfinder 2E was almost built for this method of prep out of hand. It's almost too easy! First, let's go over some of the fundamentals.

## The Ultimate Fundamentals

One of the best features of Pathfinder 2E from a lazy piece of shit GM's perspective is how much easier planning is on the backend. From Level 1 all the way to Level 20, each level will cost the player 1000 XP. This does a few incredible things to simplify encounter building. Because XP is pinned to a particular value, this means that 

## The Way of the Lazy Dungeonmaster

[The Return of the Lazy Dungeonmaster](https://slyflourish.com/lazydm/) was an absolute revelation to me because it let's me get away with doing only about 45 minutes of prep so long as I'm not being a freak about setting up a VTT. So long as I stay away from fiddling around in Foundry, I can be in and out and still do other things the rest of the night, like procrastinating this further by writing a blog post about it while [Dance Yrself Clean](https://open.spotify.com/track/2cmRpmO04TLaKPzmAzySYZ) starts really blasting hell yeah dude. 

So here's the whole thing, it's basically a just a little worksheet. Here it is as a simple bulleted list.

1. List & Review your PCs -  See what hooks you can use to connect the players to another thing further down the list.
2. Start Strong - There's a reason so many TV shows have cold opens. Start with a bang and everybody is on-board immediately. Kicking the door in helps a lot, but can get old.
3. Preview Your Scenes - List three to five scenes that might happen during your play session. These don't have to be too complicated, but this can be difficult. The rest of the list is here to help.
4. Archive Secrets & Clues - List 8-10 secrets or clues, hook-like facts about the world the players do not know. Try to keep them separate from NPCs and locations so you can slot them in where you need them.
5. Recount Fantastic Locations - List four to five locations, each with three fantastical aspects. The weirder the better. This is fantasy, you want it to be memorable.
6. Revisit Important NPCs - List five NPCs that could be involved in the session in some way and give them  a description, including casting their actor.
7. Potential Monsters - Four to six potential monsters that could be involved in the session in some say.
8. Potential Treasure - Four to five pieces of treasure, budgeted to fit their level goals. 

This is a pretty easy list[^4] to check off, especially if you keep a few things in mind.

1. Try to keep each of these components as independent from each other as possible. That is to say, try to keep them from being dependent on each other. This way you can use their story hooks to connect them together more easily.
2. Tackle the list in whatever order you want to do it in, this is only Sly's suggested order for most session preps.

Keeping that in mind, let's combine this with another method!

## The MCDM Method

Matt Colville is a fantasic resource for mostly system agnostic advice in game mastering, in part due to his strong opinions about 4E in a deeply 5e world. He recently published a [great video](https://youtu.be/cfiaf9q9Wgo) that I immediately recognized as something that slots into the Way of the Lazy Dungeonmaster very easily. See, one of the biggest hurdles I have the most diffculty is #3, which is unfortunate because it's just a great way to brainstorm basic encounters. If I had an easier time with it, I could even more quickly build out

You're able to pretty easily [turn this tool into the ultimate GM's laptop tools](https://www.patreon.com/posts/67310539). I can't recommend reading through this enough.
