My go to move when making a character for any TTRPG is to make the *Zealot of a Small Order*. A lot of the time for me this takes the form of a Lawful Neutral dwarf cleric who is utterly devoted to one very specific reading of one very particular facet of  one domain a given major deity.[^1] It's so fun and easy to come up with a character concept that has an interesting perspective by taking that reading to its logical conclusion at a Heroic 11[^1] I like that *Zealots of Small Orders* tend to be earnest weirdos who seldom fit in. I love the idea of dedicating your life to an aberrant perspective on minutae.

In exploring these concepts I have somtimes dreamed up a few fun and/or interesting Small Orders on which to base my zealots, and the two which I write about today are reflections of each other. They are what happens when the god of practicality is killed in cold blood, and what mortal apostles do after outliving the god they expected to outlive ten more generations.

### Context
This story takes place after Lathander's insurgent attempt to acquire supreme divine power by remaking the pantheon in his own image, an event now known as the Dawn Cataclysm. It's hard to place divine events on mortal timelines accurately due to the immense and awesome scale alone, though it's thought that it was about -255 DR when the goddess of the depths, Umberlee, sprung upon Murdane, Helm's lover, and dragged her to the bottom of the sea in her briny emrace.  It's commonly said that Helm holds an iron cold grudge against Lathander to this very day for instigating the events that caused the god of guardians to lose what he cherished most. What's not as commonly known is how this attitude is tempered by Lathander's own loss in Tyche. 

What is hardly known at all is Helm's impotent rage at Umberlee over the affair. Picture in your mind the god Helm, covered entrely in plate armor, his helm drawn tightly over his face leaving only a dark slit where eyes should be. Waves will win this fight *every single time.* No contest. So Helm does not fight. This is why it's natural to feel uneasy on water as you leave Helm's protection and give yourself in to the mercy of Umberlee, the bodily feeling of that divine protection being stripped away. 

### Vigilants of the Drowned Goddess
Having lost the tempering effect of Murdane's presence, some Helmites devoted themselves to lifelong vigils intended to prevent losses to the dark depths of Umberlee's embrace. Retaining a flair for the dramatic, thsse devotees of Helm seal themselves into ornate lighthouses and serve as their keepers until they are claimed by their god.  A stereotypal anchorite is a seventh daughter of noble upbringing with a religious bent and a preference for independence, seclusion, and indoor life. Often times a wealthy family that supports theanchorite will lavish the lighthouse with amenities to make their family member more comfortable throughout her stay.

While it's undeniably good that they're there, it's certainly an ostentatious display 

### Celebrants of the Drowned Goddess
The sudden loss of their god sent the disciples of Murdane into a shock and mourning, a tumultuous period which saw as many as 5% of members break their vows and leave their respective orders.But the apostles of the goddess of pragmatism will not let a
