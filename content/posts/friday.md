Today was another great day! Easy peasy. The kiddo is doing great meeting new people which is a huge relief. 

We went to visit my 94 year old grandmother today and introduced her to the little guy and we had a lot of fun. My cousin and uncle were there too and I got to really geek out about sci-fi stuff with them. Got some really great recommendations!

There's a huge power shift between my parents and me since the baby arrived. It's like my dad finally is showing me a modicum of respect as an adult and it only took 33 fucking years to get it and it's maybe the least deserving reason. It's frustrating to think that he will never be able to understand or appreciate really anything I do. What's worse is how

I remember when I was just in college before failing out the first time he got really into video games, you know, sort of as a way to reach out. But not actually, he got into studying video games for work, which I'm not interested in at all. He studied reaching out. When I was not receptive he found a student my age who was and they have had a long and fruitful career together. I'm glad he's happy with his new son at least. 

I'm going to try to talk to him about starting to write letters. We're bad at talking verbally andi think both of us operate better through text. I sometimes wonder if that's even worth it though.

That got sad. I'm sitting here now feeding my son a late night bottle and I'm going to promise now to not do that dumb shit to him. Hold me to it.
