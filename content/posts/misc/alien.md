When I was between 10 and 13, my dad started to raplidly collect a series of dead-end telecommunications technologies that he was sure were going to be the next big thing. That's not fair, it was only one or two, but the big one was the dial-up internet connection we had hooked up. Thankfully, that too ended up being just as much a fad as the IBM beige landline phone with a screen that could tilt to make the basement flourscent lights glare acros the cheap plastic a little worse.[^1] I fell in love with the slow connection immediately, particularly the Yahoo Kidz services which lead me to the rest of Yahoo, including the chats. Precious little wizlet I was, I would hang out in the most mature sounding rooms possible[^2]

[^1]: Heaven forbid something as awful as a global network established to freely distriute information to all users would be. No way to monetize somthing like that without utterly breaking anything of value in it. 
[^2]: I now realize that with the title, some of you may be expecting something a bit more salacious.
